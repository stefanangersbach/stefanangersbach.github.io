I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at SVA. Before working for SVA I was co-founder at Siasys GmbH, a Data Science Consulting Firm with focus on industrial IoT.  

My topic of interest are use cases regarding financial data such as credit card fraud or insider trading. Those cases usually consist of imbalanced data sets and hidden dependencies that require advanced data treatment before applying Machine Learning Models on them. Over the years, working as Data Scientist, I also got familiar with all the steps that are necessary for deploying ML Pipelines into production.

I am originally from Frankfurt Germany. Before specializing in Data Science, I studied Applied Mathematics at Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences and Friedberg University of Applied Sciences. In my spare time I am experimenting with financial data sets trying to beat the stock market.


My name is Inigo Montoya. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
